my own implementation of the schelling model. see http://nifty.stanford.edu/2014/mccown-schelling-model-segregation/

I saw this algorithm being discussed at a seminar at my community college. at the time i thought it was pretty cool, so i went and implemented it on my own.

this uses jansi (https://github.com/fusesource/jansi) which helped to put some color in the console output.
